### A Note on the API

The API I'm using is this [Animals API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/animals)

The API has information about lots of animals, but how much information is very inconsistent from animal to animal. I think I have done a good job accounting for this in my code, but if there seems to be some missing content here and there (such as missing latin names, few characteristics, etc), it is probably because the data provided for an animal by the API is incomplete.
